PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED IN TESTING:

1. DUPLICATION OF SETUP CODE:
   - Each test creates the same objects (repositories, services)
   - No central place to create test data
   - Repeated initialization patterns

2. LACK OF REUSABLE COMPONENTS:
   - Create test products in each test separately
   - Lack of factories to create test objects
   - No auxiliary methods for frequent operations

3. LACK OF ABSTRACTION:
   - Tests directly create all dependencies
   - No test builders/mothers/fixtures
   - No abstraction layer for common test scenarios

SOLUTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Test Base Classes:
   - Base test class with setup
   - Abstract test case for different types of tests

2 Test Data Builders/Mothers:
   - ProductMother.createLaptop()
   - CartBuilder.withProduct().withQuantity().build()
   - OrderFixture.pendingOrder()

3 - Test Utilities:
   - TestServiceFactory
   - TestDataProvider
   - AssertionHelpers

4 Test Scenarios:
   - Reusable business scenarios
   - Common test flows
   - Shared test contexts
