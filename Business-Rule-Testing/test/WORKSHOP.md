Team Tasks:

Team 1: Write classic tests using Given-When-Then for `calculateDiscount()`.
Team 2: Refactor provided test to use parameterized test cases.
Team 3: Extract rule logic into separate classes (e.g., `VipDiscountRule`) and test it in isolation.
Team 4: Simulate property-based testing by verifying invariants (e.g., VIP discount is always <= 0.20 and >= 0.0).
